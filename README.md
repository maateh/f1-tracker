## F1 Statistics & Weekend Schedule Tracker
> The project has been archived.

---

A simple [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/) statistics and weekend schedule tracker app built in [React](https://react.dev).

It's used the [Ergast F1 API](https://github.com/jcnewell/ergast-f1-api), which has been deprecated unfortunately.
I started working [on my own API](https://github.com/maateh/ergast-f1-node-api) for the project based on the official Ergast DB dumps which were published by the original author, but I never finished it. To be precise, I barely finished the backend API service, but I never implemented/switched to it on the frontend due to I reworked everything from the ground up - *and to be honest, the code of **this** project isn't something I'd ever like to touch again.*
